Hermann - Home nEtwoRk Monitoring ANd diagNostics
=================================================

This solution aims at implementing a simple way of monitoring home network. The central collecting device
is running Windows 10 IoT (Raspberry Pi 2) and acquires information from various manageable units, e.g., 
Internet Gateway, smart sensors, etc. 

The collecting devices performs basic preprocessing and data is then sent to central server for further analysis. The cenral server is hosted in cloud environment and has Web based user interface.
